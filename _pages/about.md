I am a machine learning scientist at Apple working on developing algorithms for signals collected from wearable devices. My current research focus is large-scale representation learning in form of unsupervised or self-supervised learning particularly for time-series data. You can find my CV here.

I got my BSc from Sharif University of Technology in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Economics. After that, I received my MSc in Computer Science from University of Southern California focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning, where I also got my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Maryam Shanechi. My research focus throughout PhD was developing statistical machine learning tools to improve brain-machine interfaces and understand the brain. I developed latent variable dynamic models for characterizing multi-modal time-series, neural network latent variable dynamic models of time-series that enable flexible inference, artificial recurrent neural networks that recapitulate brain manifolds, and self-supervised contrastive learning models for high-dimensional time-series. In summer 2021, I was a machine learning intern at Apple, where I developed self-supervised deep learning models for signals from wearable devices.

Outside work, most of my free time is spent working out, playing/watching soccer, traveling or hanging out with friends. I also enjoy learning about new scientific concepts, and am currently learning about physical training, nutrition, and finance.
